<p>I was born and raised in rural Nova Scotia. From 2012 to 2017 I studied earth sciences (BSc) and GIS (post-grad diploma). I spent two years after graduation working as a GIS Research Technician for StFX University. Since then, I have been working in provincial government. First as a GIS Analyst for NS Lands &amp; Forestry, and now as a Geologist for NS Energy &amp; Mines.</p>

<p>My main hobbies are gardening, hiking, and bitcoin.</p>
