# Back to work
So I guess it's been 2 1/2 years since I first tried to make a Jekyll website. I know a lot more about development now, and feel more comfortable using Jekyll (even though I haven't had any more web/software experience directly...)

My plan is to keep working on this site as my personal "landing page" - it will likely have a bio/CV as well as links to my other projects (more to come on those later)
