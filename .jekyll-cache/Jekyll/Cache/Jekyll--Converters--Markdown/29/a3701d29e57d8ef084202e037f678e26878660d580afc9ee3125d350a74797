<p>So I guess itâ€™s been 2 1/2 years since I first tried to make a Jekyll website. I know a lot more about development now, and feel more comfortable using Jekyll (even though I havenâ€™t had any more web/software experience directlyâ€¦)</p>

<p>My plan is to keep working on this site as my personal â€œlanding pageâ€ - it will likely have a bio/CV as well as links to my other projects (more to come on those later)</p>
