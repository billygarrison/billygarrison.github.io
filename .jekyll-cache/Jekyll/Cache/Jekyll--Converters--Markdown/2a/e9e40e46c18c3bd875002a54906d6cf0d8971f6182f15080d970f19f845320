I"€<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in rural Nova Scotia. From 2012 to 2017 I studied earth sciences (BSc) and GIS (post-grad diploma). I spent two years after graduation working as a GIS Research Technician for StFX University. Since then, I have been working in provincial government. First as a GIS Analyst for NS Lands &amp; Forestry, and now as a Geologist for NS Energy &amp; Mines.</p>

<p>My main hobbies are gardening, hiking, foraging, and bitcoin (<em>one of these things is not like the other‚Ä¶</em>). The over-arching theme that ties most of my interests together is ‚Äúself sufficiency‚Äù. I believe people should be able to take care of themselves, without relying on the comforts and conveniences that our society makes available. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with taking advantage of society‚Äôs benefits, but we shouldn‚Äôt consider them everlasting. This has been my belief for many years, but the COVID-19 pandemic has proven the value of self sufficiency.</p>

<p>Growing my own food brings me peace of mind, knowing that supply chain issues wont affect me. Hiking gets me out into nature and keeps me healthy and happy. Foraging is fun and it complements gardening well. Bitcoin, like these other hobbies, brings me peace of mind. Bitcoin lets me ‚Äúbe my own bank‚Äù, without needing to rely on anyone else. While most of my spare time is spent working in the garden or hanging out in nature, most of my spare time online is spent learning about bitcoin.</p>
