<p>Welcome to my website. This is a temporary placeholder while I learn how to use Jekyll to build my website.</p>

<p>Jekyll lets you use HTML or markdown to create content that gets converted into a website.</p>

<p>You can also use HTML code as well (this might be true of all markdown?). For example: <a href="/about">Read more about my lifeâ€¦</a></p>
